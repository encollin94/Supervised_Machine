# Supervised_Machine

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis was to implement supervised machine learning techniques into a large set of data. Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, I oversampled the data and undersampled the data using different algorithms.  Using these algorithms, I will create more sensitive machinne learning algoreithms to  he predict credit card risk
